            <a><b>Pasig River:</b> 
                Historically and culturally significant 
                waterway in the Philippines, has long been a vital part of 
                the country's history, economy, and ecosystem. However, it has 
                faced severe biodiversity loss due to urbanization, pollution, and neglect.

            <a><b>Significance of the Pasig River:</b> 
            The Pasig River spans about 27 kilometers, connecting Laguna de Bay to Manila Bay. 
            It traverses several major cities, including Manila, Makati, and Pasig, making it a 
            central waterway for transportation and commerce. Historically, the river served as 
            a crucial trade route and continues to support local industries and informal settlers 
            reliant on fishing and water resources.

                <h2>Biodiversity Loss</h2>
                <p> - Decline or extinction of species, habitats, and ecosystems, often caused 
                    by human activities such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change. 
                    This loss disrupts ecosystems and the services they provide, like clean air, 
                    water, and food. The diminishing diversity of life can have far-reaching 
                    effects on the balance of nature, reducing resilience to environmental changes.</p>

            <div class="slider">
                <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                <p> - The Pasig River was the lifeline of Manila, serving as a major transportation 
                    and trade hub. Many historical landmarks, such as Intramuros and the Walled 
                    City, are situated along its banks.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>- Rapid industrialization and population growth after World War II led to the 
                river's decline, with untreated sewage, industrial waste, and urban runoff 
                severely affecting water quality and biodiversity.</p>
