            <p>Historically, the Pasig River connected Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay, 
                acting as a lifeline for the city. During the pre-colonial and Spanish 
                colonial eras, it served as a center for trade and transportation. Due 
                to the river's wealth, communities flourished along its banks. The river 
                was rich in biodiversity, with fish and indigenous plants that provided 
                for the livelihoods of the local populace. The river also had a cultural 
                significance; it was frequently depicted as a symbol of life and connection 
                in Filipino literature and history.<br><br>
            However, the river declined in the 20th century. The formerly healthy 
                ecology became a highly polluted waterway due to industrialization, population 
                increase, and inadequate waste management. Pasig River was declared biologically 
                dead, meaning it could no longer support aquatic life.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Recognizing Biodiversity Loss:</b> By analyzing their reduction, we can gain a better understanding of how pollution, industrialization, and urbanization affect regional biodiversity.</li>
                <li><b>Cultural and Historical Significance:</b> Many of these species were important to the customs and means of subsistence of the riverbank people. Emphasizing them promotes cultural memory preservation and the importance of reestablishing a connection with Manila's natural heritage.</li>
                <li><b>Policy and Development Implications:</b> Historical viewpoints offer a prism through which to evaluate ongoing and upcoming development initiatives, such as PAREX. They encourage people to consider how environmental preservation and urbanization may coexist.</li>
                <li><b>Goals for Ecosystem Restoration:</b> Restoring species that were once abundant in the Pasig River can be used as a standard for effective restoration. By learning about the past abundance of species like kanduli, people can envision what a rehabilitated Pasig River might look like. Historical context gives clarity to what "restoration" truly means.</li>
                <li><b>Education and Advocacy:</b> Public awareness and participation in environmental conservation can be stimulated by showcasing these species. It draws attention to what has been lost and explains why initiatives like the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) are so important.</li>

            <p>The river was once a part of Manila's lively urban life, where people used it for 
                fishing and bathing in the early 1900s. However, as the city grew in population 
                and the river became used to the informal sector, there was a noticeable decline 
                in both commercial and personal activities in the river, which was equal to a 
                decline in fish migration and reproduction. <br><br>
            The river's activities continued to deteriorate until 1970, at which point its water 
            quality began to fall below the Class "C" level, meaning that it was unsuitable for 
            any river activities, could no longer sustain aquatic life other than janitor fish
             and water lilies, and was only suited for irrigation.</p>

        <p>After several attempts by the government and private sectors to rehabilitate 
            the Pasig River, the vision of its restoration became clear when a citizen 
            caught a freshwater tilapia in Sta. Ana, Manila. This served as proof of 
            the river’s improvement.</p><br><br>
        <p>A study from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, alongside 
            the Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau, highlighted the presence 
            of tilapia and seven other fish species—such as Manila sea catfish, bighead 
            carp, and Indo-Pacific tarpon—living in the Pasig River since 2009. In addition 
            to these fish, various species of aquatic plants, birds, trees, and other 
            vegetation were also found thriving in this once-polluted river.</p>
