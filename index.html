                The Pasig River spans about 27 kilometers, connecting Laguna de Bay to Manila Bay. 
                It traverses several major cities, including Manila, Makati, and Pasig, making it a 
                central waterway for transportation and commerce. Historically, the river served as 
                a crucial trade route and continues to support local industries and informal settlers 
                reliant on fishing and water resources.

                    <h2>Biodiversity Loss</h2>
                    <p> Decline or extinction of species, habitats, and ecosystems, often caused 
                        by human activities such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change. 
                        This loss disrupts ecosystems and the services they provide, like clean air, 
                        water, and food. The diminishing diversity of life can have far-reaching 
                        effects on the balance of nature, reducing resilience to environmental changes.</p>

                    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                    <p> The Pasig River was the lifeline of Manila, serving as a major transportation 
                        and trade hub. Many historical landmarks, such as Intramuros and the Walled 
                        City, are situated along its banks.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p> Rapid industrialization and population growth after World War II led to the 
                        river's decline, with untreated sewage, industrial waste, and urban runoff 
                        severely affecting water quality and biodiversity.</p>

                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p> We are a group of students dedicated to protecting the Pasig River, a vital 
                        waterway with great environmental, cultural, and historical significance 
                        for our communities. Through this website, we aim to inspire meaningful 
                        actions that will restore the river to its full potential.</p>

                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>The formerly healthy ecology became a highly polluted waterway due to 
                        industrialization, population increase, and inadequate waste management. 
                        Pasig River was declared biologically dead, meaning it could no longer 
                        support aquatic life.

                    <h2>Progress Made</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Pasig River Rehabilitation has seen efforts from various administrations 
                        and organizations. These initiatives focused on cleaning the polluted river, 
                        addressing urbanization challenges, and raising public awareness. Current efforts, 
                        such as the Pasig River Urban Development Project, aim to balance ecological 
                        restoration with urban development for improved living conditions and sustainability.</p>
