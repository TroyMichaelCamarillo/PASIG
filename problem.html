                <p>Historically, the Pasig River connected Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay, acting as a lifeline for the city. During the pre-colonial and Spanish colonial eras, it served as a center for trade and transportation. Due to the river's wealth, communities flourished along its banks. The river was rich in biodiversity, with fish and indigenous plants that provided for the livelihoods of the local populace. The river also had a cultural significance; it was frequently depicted as a symbol of life and connection in Filipino literature and history.</p>

            Fun Fact: The name Manila is derived from the 
            term "Maynila", which comes from the Tagalog words 
            "may" (meaning "there is") and "nilad", which refers 
            to a type of flowering mangrove plant (Scyphiphora 
            hydrophyllacea) that once thrived along the shores 
            of Manila Bay.

                <li><b>Recognizing Biodiversity Loss:</b> By analyzing their reduction, we can gain a better understanding of how pollution, industrialization, and urbanization affect regional biodiversity.</li>
                <li><b>Cultural and Historical Significance:</b> Many of these species were important to the customs and means of subsistence of the riverbank people. Emphasizing them promotes cultural memory preservation and the importance of reestablishing a connection with Manila's natural heritage.</li>
                <li><b>Policy and Development Implications:</b> Historical viewpoints offer a prism through which to evaluate ongoing and upcoming development initiatives, such as PAREX. They encourage people to consider how environmental preservation and urbanization may coexist.</li>
                <li><b>Goals for Ecosystem Restoration:</b> Restoring species that were once abundant in the Pasig River can be used as a standard for effective restoration. By learning about the past abundance of species like kanduli, people can envision what a rehabilitated Pasig River might look like. Historical context gives clarity to what "restoration" truly means.</li>
                <li><b>Education and Advocacy:</b> Public awareness and participation in environmental conservation can be stimulated by showcasing these species. It draws attention to what has been lost and explains why initiatives like the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) are so important.</li>

                <p>The river was once a part of Manila's lively urban life, where people used it for 
                    fishing and bathing in the early 1900s. However, as the city grew in population 
                    and the river became used to the informal sector, there was a noticeable decline 
                    in both commercial and personal activities in the river, which was equal to a 
                    decline in fish migration and reproduction. <br><br>
                The river's activities continued to deteriorate until 1970, at which point its water 
                quality began to fall below the Class "C" level, meaning that it was unsuitable for 
                any river activities, could no longer sustain aquatic life other than janitor fish
                and water lilies, and was only suited for irrigation.</p>

            <p>After several attempts by the government and private sectors to rehabilitate 
                the Pasig River, the vision of its restoration became clear when a citizen 
                caught a freshwater tilapia in Sta. Ana, Manila. This served as proof of 
                the river’s improvement.</p><br><br>
            <p>A study from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, alongside 
                the Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau, highlighted the presence 
                of tilapia and seven other fish species—such as Manila sea catfish, bighead 
                carp, and Indo-Pacific tarpon—living in the Pasig River since 2009. In addition 
                to these fish, various species of aquatic plants, birds, trees, and other 
                vegetation were also found thriving in this once-polluted river.</p>

    <div class="parex_info">
        The Pasig Expressway (PAREX), proposed by San Miguel Corporation Infrastructure, 
        is designed to be a 19.37-kilometer, six-lane elevated expressway running the 
        entire stretch of the Pasig River. It aims to provide a faster route connecting 
        Metro Manila’s major business districts, such as Makati, Ortigas, and Bonifacio Global City.<br><br>
        Reducing traffic congestion and drastically reducing travel times throughout 
        Metro Manila is the project's primary objective. Its secondary goal is to 
        assist with the Pasig River's cleanup and rehabilitation.  Lastly, it could 
        work alongside the ferry boats operating on the Pasig River.

    <div class="controversy_info">
        It may showcase itself to help alleviate the Manila traffic, but 
        some who oppose call the PAREX as the “Pasig River’s death sentence,” 
        as it will worsen and not solve traffic congestion. Aside from it being 
        car centric, it will cause environmental issues such as killing of the 
        Pasig River and heritage erasure.<br><br>
        According to one of the petitions, the efforts made to restore the Pasig River 
        will be in vain and will not take into account the demands of the next generation 
        of the residents. Additionally, causing transport above the Pasig River will 
        increase non-exhaust emissions like road dust, particulate matter, and microplastics 
        from car tires, which will contaminate our rivers, streams, and oceans.
